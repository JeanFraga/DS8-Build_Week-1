https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/l/components/layout

Layout in Bootstrap is controlled using the grid system. The Bootstrap grid has 
twelve columns.

There are three main layout components in dash-bootstrap-components: Container, 
Row, and Col.

The layout of your app should be built as a series of rows of columns.

We set md=4 indicating that on a 'medium' sized or larger screen each column 
should take up a third of the width. Since we don't specify behaviour on 
smaller size screens Bootstrap will allow the rows to wrap so as not to squash 
the content.

            ## What rating will your restaurant receive?

            This data allows us to predict the possible rating a user might give based on his profile and the information available about the restaurant. The ratings we can predict are:
            
            1. Overal rating
            2. Food rating
            3. Service rating

            My project revolves around the data gathered from 130 restaurants in Mexico and subsequently the rating those received from 138 users. 

            ðŸ‘‰ With the graph on the right you can choose one of the 3 ratings and see what features mattered the most when predicting what rating the restaurant would receive by each user.

            If you would like to see how changing some of these features individually affect the rating the restaurant is likely to receive please click below.
