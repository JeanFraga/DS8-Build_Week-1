https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/l/components/layout

Layout in Bootstrap is controlled using the grid system. The Bootstrap grid has 
twelve columns.

There are three main layout components in dash-bootstrap-components: Container, 
Row, and Col.

The layout of your app should be built as a series of rows of columns.

We set md=4 indicating that on a 'medium' sized or larger screen each column 
should take up a third of the width. Since we don't specify behaviour on 
smaller size screens Bootstrap will allow the rows to wrap so as not to squash 
the content.

            ## What rating will your restaurant receive?

            This data allows us to predict the possible rating a user might give based on his profile and the information available about the restaurant. The ratings we can predict are:
            
            1. Overal rating
            2. Food rating
            3. Service rating

            ðŸ‘‰ With the graph on the right you can choose a row from the total data and see what my model predicts he/she will vote.

            My project revolves around the data gathered from 130 restaurants in Mexico and subsequently the rating those received from 138 users. 
            
            This data has a lot of information we can use to make a prediction. Listed below are just a few I have picked out to show the ones that had the most impact on all three ratings.

            'ulatitude', 'height', 'upays_cash', 'upays_visa', 'ucuisine_cafeteria',
